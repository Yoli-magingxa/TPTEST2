    "Selection sort has a quadratic time complexity of O(n^2), which means its performance degrades rapidly with larger input sizes. This makes it inefficient for sorting large arrays or datasets.Despite its simplicity, selection sort is not suitable for large datasets due to its poor time complexity compared to more efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.\n",
